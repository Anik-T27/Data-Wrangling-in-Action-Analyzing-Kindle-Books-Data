# 📚 Data Wrangling in Action: Analyzing Kindle Books Data

Welcome to the **Kindle Books Data Wrangling Project**, where we dive deep into messy, real-world book data and transform it into valuable insights! This project demonstrates hands-on **data wrangling techniques** using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries on a dataset sourced from **Datawars.io**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase end-to-end data wrangling by:

- Importing and exploring raw Kindle book data
- Cleaning and transforming the dataset
- Deriving meaningful insights such as top-rated authors, most expensive books, pricing trends, and more
- Visualizing trends with clean, insightful plots


---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Handling missing data, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting
- ✅ Feature engineering from textual and numerical data
- ✅ Filtering and grouping for trend analysis
- ✅ Descriptive statistics for author/book-level insights
- ✅ Beautiful visualizations for storytelling

---

## 📈 Sample Insights

Here are a few insights derived from the wrangled data:

- 🔝 Top 10 most-reviewed authors and their average ratings  
- 💰 Price distribution of Kindle books across genres  
- ⭐ Correlation between rating, price, and review count  
- 🧮 Word count analysis from book titles and descriptions
